## Tools üõ†Ô∏è
This project was implemented with
- IDE : S32DS
- No SDK used, every code was written baremetal
- PCB on Altium Designer

## Features üöÄ
- Trapezoidal control
- Unipolar PWM control
- Complementary PWM switching
- UI for reading engine's RPM
- RPM's value settable with potentiometer 

## Measurement üìê

Every images from oscilloscope follow the same color logic associated to phase or hall input.

$${\color{yellow}Phase/Hall A} \break
{\color{cyan}Phase/Hall B} \enter
{\color{orange}Phase/Hall C} \enter
{\color{green}Internal \space signal \space generated \space after \space a \space hall \space sequence}$$


Internal signal should be used as debugging because of engine had 31 poles, so with that signal was easier to understand the sequence.
