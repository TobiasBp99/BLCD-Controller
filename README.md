## Tools üõ†Ô∏è
This project was implemented with
- IDE : S32DS
- No SDK used, every code was written baremetal
- PCB on Altium Designer

## Features üöÄ
- Trapezoidal control
- Unipolar PWM control
- Complementary PWM switching
- UI for reading engine's RPM
- RPM's value settable with potentiometer 

## Measurement üìê

Every images from oscilloscope follow the same color logic associated to phase or hall input.

- ![#00aae4](https://placehold.co/15x15/00aae4/00aae4.png) `Phase/Hall B`
- ![#ffa500](https://placehold.co/15x15/ffa500/ffa500.png) `Phase/Hall C`
- ![#008f39](https://placehold.co/15x15/008f39/008f39.png) `Internal signal generated after a hall sequence`

Internal signal should be used as debugging because of engine had 31 poles, so with that signal was easier to understand the sequence.
